## Fantasy Stocks

# Overview
Fantasy Stocks is a stock simulator for the Android. However, it is different in that the focus is on 
head-to-head competition rather than simply making money. This means careful management of stocks and 
liquid assets so that you can come out on top every week.

This started as a high school project in a computer science class between Jimmy Hua, Daniel Beard, and Noah Podolske.
